# Airline-On-Time-Performance-Analysis
In this data analysis project, we'll dive into the "Airline Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance Dataset" from IBM : https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/airline/

## Context :
Flight cancellations and delays can cause big problems for passengers and airlines. It's really important to try and prevent these issues because they make customers unhappy and airlines lose money. In 2022, all the airlines together lost $6.9 billion. Avoiding these disruptions helps airlines run better, keeps their good reputation, and makes travelers feel more confident about flying.

## Project Overview

In this data analysis project, we'll dive into the "Airline Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance Dataset" from IBM, which contains information about domestic flights in the United States from 1987 to 2020. Our main goals for this project are to learn about how often airlines are on time, figure out why flights get delayed, and create a smart tool that can predict delays. By doing this, we want to find useful information and ideas to make air travel in the US more reliable and efficient.

## Project Goals

1. Spotting Punctual and Late Airlines

Check the data to see which airlines are usually on time and which ones often have delays

2. Airport Delay Investigation

Find out which airports have the least and most delayed flights.

3. Getting to the Bottom of Delays

Explore the main reasons behind flight delays, like bad weather, air traffic problems, or plane issues
